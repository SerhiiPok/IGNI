# IGNI

Igni is:
* a Python application which converts game assets (models, animations, etc.) from the Witcher 1 game into file formats (e.g. `fbx`) that can be understood by and imported into the Unreal Engine (and other applications if you need). The application can convert single assets or any number of assets in batch. 
* a set of Python utility scripts for the Unreal Engine used for material generation and other actions on the imported assets

Below is a sample scene built with Witcher 1 assets converted by Igni:
